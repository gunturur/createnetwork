#Copy the PostXML.py and PostXML.cfg files to the same directory as your script.
#Edit the PostXML.cfg file to match your SAM configuration - you can use hostnames or IPs.

#To import, do:

from PostXML import PostXML

my_xml_string = '''
<ping xmlns="xmlapi_1.0"/>
'''

#To use, instantiate a new object:

MyXMLPoster = PostXML()

#This object can be re-used to send multiple requests, if desired.

#To send a request, use the xml_request method:

MyXMLPoster.xml_request(my_xml_string)


#This call returns a boolean, so you can test and call at the same time:

if MyXMLPoster.xml_request(my_xml_string):
        #Parse results
        print "Result was good!"
else:
        #//Do something if the request failed for some reason.
        print "Something bad happened."

#Two main attributes are available from the request:
MyXMLPoster.status
MyXMLPoster.response

#status should be 200 if everything was ok, else something went wrong (check Http error codes for more details)
#response wholes the entire SOAP response as sent back by SAM. Use this for parsing.

#If status !=200 or xml_request returns false for whatever reason, check this variable:
MyXMLPoster.error_string

#Cause I wasn't fancy enough to create custom errors
